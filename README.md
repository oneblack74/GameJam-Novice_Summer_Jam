# 🕒 60 Seconds to Escape
> 🎮 Game made for the Novice Summer Jam Series 2024: Mini Jam 2
---
### 🔥 Concept

You are trapped in an escape room, and the clock is ticking...
You only have one minute to find a way out!
Look around, find clues, and take notes. The room resets every 60 seconds, but your notepad doesn’t!
Stay sharp, and maybe… just maybe… you’ll escape in time.

> 💡 Tip: Use your notepad wisely – it’s your only persistent tool.
